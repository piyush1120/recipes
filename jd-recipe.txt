Get a bottle of Jack Daniels/Gentlemen's Jack and watch it, smell
it for atleast 2 hrs, to get the feel.
get yourself a whiskey glass and a tumbler of ice bucket.
make sure you have a heat insulated bucket for you may want to 
use that ice for quite a long time.
pull the bottle, open the seal, smell it, kiss it.
pour a 60ml peg into your glass and bring in the cheese wongtong
and some tandoori chicken to complement the whiskey.
make sure you don't use any other diluting liquid like water, soda
if you can't comply then only grab a bottle of diet coke and nothing else.
enjoy!!
